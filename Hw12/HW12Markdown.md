# HW12 Markdown
- we use quickSort in order to sort the information
- create minimum spanning tree
- create a counter and the cost
- for all the edges on the edge list
- if the edge doesn't create a cycle
- add it to the minimum spanning tree
- increment count and cost
- if we've added all of the houses to the MST finish
- return the cost
