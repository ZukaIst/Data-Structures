- Create a List of Lists of integers to return
- Sort the given array using mergesort
- Have a for loop iterate through the sorted array, skipping duplicates
- Store the left and right bounds
- Have a while loop to calculate the sum
- If the sum is 0, add it to the list
- Otherwise increate the left and right and continue
- After the loop, return the list of lists
