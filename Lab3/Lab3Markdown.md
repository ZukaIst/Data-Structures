## Problem 1
- 10000000000n^(2) vs n^(3) : bigger is n^(3)
- n^2 log(n) vs n(log(n))^(10) : bigger is n^2 log(n)
- n^(logn) vs 2^sqrt(n) : bigger is n^(logn)
- 2^(n) vs 2^(2n) : bigger is 2^(2n)

## Problem 2
- Best Case: O(1)
  - if it finds it to be false it will only go through it once.
- Average Case: O(sqrt(n))
  - it goes through it faster becuase it multiplies, not O(1) since it's not instant all the time.
- Worst Case: O(sqrt(n))
  - it usually goes through it and i multiplies until the prime is found.
