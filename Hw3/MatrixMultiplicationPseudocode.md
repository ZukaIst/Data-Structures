# Complexity Analysis For The Matrix Multiplication Pseudocode
- First for loop, interates through rows A ( O(m) )
- Second for loop, interates through columns B ( O(n) )
- Third for loop, iterates through columns A ( O(p) )
- There is three for loops 
- ( m x n x p = mnp )
- Therefore time complexity is O(mnp)
