# Time Complexity Analysis For Insertion Sort
- Needs two for loops
- First one, iterates through array to get the current value ( Run Time: O(n) )
- Second one, compares the current value to everything before it ( Run Time: O(n) )
- (n x n = n^2) Therefore time complexity is O(n^2)
- Best Case = O(n), because if it is already sorted it only needs to go through it once
