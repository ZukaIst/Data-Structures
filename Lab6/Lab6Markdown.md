# Lab6
- make a array to store indegrees
- make an adjanceny list
- make a for loop to fill adj with arraylists
- make a for loop to fill indegree array and put in adj
- make a queue
- Now the 0 indegree nodes have been found and added to the queue
- make a number that counts all the removed nodes
- While the queue is not empty
- Remove a node from the queue.
- increment the counter
- For each outgoing edge from the node, decrement the indegree of the destination
- If the in-degree of a destination node becomes 0, add it to the queue
- then finally return true if the number is equal to the number of courses, otherwise false
