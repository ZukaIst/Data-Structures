- check to make sure that the aray is not empty and that the color at the original position is not the given color
- save the color at the original position
- make a queue to store position's neighbors
- then, add the original position to the queue
- make a while loop for when the queue is not empty
- remove the first position from the queue and save it into a variable 'location'
- make an if statement for checking if the color at the orginal position is equal to the color at the current position
- if so then, change the current color to the given color
- and add all of its neighbors that aren't out of bound to the queue
- once, the while loop is finished return the changed 2D array
