- create left boundary of the range
- create right boundary of the range
- Use a while loop to check while the left is less than the right
- find the current half
- check if the half we found is bad
- if it is bad then we know it is on the left
- then set the right range to the middle
- otherwise, set the left range to the middle
- return once we found the first bad
- once you find an odd number, everything after is considered bad
