# Cases for Insertion Sort
- Best Case: Omega(n)
  - Because it is already sorted, it iterates through the array once

- Average Case Theta(n^2)
  - Because it is almost never going to be sorted, it still has to go through both for loops

- Worst Case O(n^2)
  - Array is unsorted,has to go through both for loops
