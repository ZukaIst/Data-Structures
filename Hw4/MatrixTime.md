# Matrix Multiplication Time Complexity
- Best Case Omega(n^3)
  - The size of all of the rows and columns are all equal
- Average Case Theta(mnp)
  - The size of all of the rows and columns are not always going to be the same size 
- Worst Case O(mnp)
  - The size of the rows and columns are all different
